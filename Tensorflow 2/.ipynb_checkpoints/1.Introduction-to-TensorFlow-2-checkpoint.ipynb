This version deprecated and removed some legacy and redundant features from TensorFlow 1.x, making it more focused and helped reduce confusion, and made the framework more accessible. Keras, a popular high-level neural networks API, became the official high-level API for TensorFlow. This integration improved the ease of use and provided a consistent interface for building and training models."
